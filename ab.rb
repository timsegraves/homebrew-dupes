      # The ab tool of the latest stable httpd (2.4.2) does not work
      # properly on systems that have both IPv4 and IPv6, i.e. OS X machines
      # running Lion or later. In particular, the patch that added the `-B'
      # option to bind to a local address disables connections to IPv4 hosts:
      # "bind: Address family not supported by protocol family (47)"
      # This issue has been fixed in SVN revision 1351737, but a
      # packaged version with this fix is not yet available.
      # Therefore, we download version 2.4.2 and patch it.
      # As soon as the next version of httpd is released, presumably version
      # 2.4.3, this will no longer be necessary.
